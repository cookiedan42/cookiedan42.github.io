I am a Systems Analyst and Software Engineer at the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) in Singapore.
My primary experience is in backend development and DevOps, with some frontend development too.  

Two of my recent projects are:

### Managing the deployment of URA's demo of ePlanner for the ESRI user conference 2024.
This deployment was done on AWS and managed using Terraform. It included setting up the CI/CD pipelines, maintaining separate dev and prod environments, mananging multiple domains and their correspinding certificates.

### Improving the performance of routing analysis workflows
This was done by transforming the data into appropriate weighted graphs and using optimized geospatial data structures.
